=============

MergeSort, a class where we set up multiple int[] arrays and sorted them through a self-coded merge sort algorithm. The merge sort algorithm goes through the list, splits it in half, sorts each half (recursively), then merges the two lists by reading the head of each list, adding to the new list and incrementing the header-index of the halflists as necessary.
Program complexity is O(n log n)
