=============

BubbleSort, a class where we set up multiple int[] arrays and sorted them through a self-coded bubble sort algorithm.
The bubble sort algorithm goes through the list n(n-1) times, swapping if out of order and eventually allowing the largest element to "bubble" up through the list.
Program complexity is O(n^2)
